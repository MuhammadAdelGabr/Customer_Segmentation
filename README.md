# Customer Segmentation Project:

This repository contains code , web app and documentation for an unsupervised machine-learning project focused on customer segmentation. 
The project explores Hierarchical clustering algorithms to group customers based on their behavior, preferences, and financial habits.

# Goals:

  ## 📝Business Goals:
  Extract meaningful patterns and insights from your customer data without relying on predefined labels or categories.
  By employing unsupervised learning techniques, you aim to group customers based on similarities in their behavior, preferences, or characteristics.
  This segmentation can then be utilized for various business purposes such as targeted marketing, personalized recommendations, product development, or optimizing service delivery.

  ## 📝Learning Goals:
  Explore several methods for customer segmentation, including:

*  **T-SNE (t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding):** A technique for visualizing high-dimensional data in lower-dimensional space while preserving local structure.

*  **Hierarchical clustering:** A method that builds a hierarchy of clusters by either merging or splitting them based on a distance metric.

*   **Kernel PCA:** An extension of PCA using kernel methods to handle nonlinear relationships in data.
 
*  **GAP statistic method:** A technique for selecting the optimal number of clusters by comparing within-cluster dispersion to that expected under a null reference distribution.</p>
